# What are SlackBots?

    Slack bots, basically works on POST/GET methods and json plays a huge role making it possible. 
    Slack Bots are really helpful for making automated responses for some common messages in 
    chat area and handling various other   tasks ..  
    Here i've used same with red team perspective :P i just defined some commands in scripts 
    and exact response it should put up   in chat are.

# Note
    Option "shell" is delivering commands over victim box but its not delivering results 
    on chat area .... i ended up scratching my head and finally added meterpreter payload 
    as its substitute, so if you come up with an idea then do ping me on twitter :) 
    would be happy to have your suggestions...
